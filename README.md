# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Design and analysis of algorithms: Turing machines; NP-Complete theory. Algorithmic techniques: divide-and- conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, graph traversal, backtracking, and branch-and-bound. Applications include sorting and searching, graph algorithms, and optimization.
